# Session Log — 20260220T000800Z

## What Was Attempted

Complete system build from scratch — all 8 phases: project structure, environment setup, memory system, OpenClaw agent, storage system, controller, cron integration, production safety.

## What Was Implemented

- Project structure with all required directories
- `scripts/setup_environment.ps1` — environment verification
- `scripts/utils/logger.py` — dual logging (file + stdout)
- `scripts/utils/memory_manager.py` — session/checkpoint/summary with atomic writes
- `agents/google_jobs_agent.yaml` — OpenClaw agent with MiniMax M2.5
- `scripts/run_agent.ps1` — agent execution wrapper with timeout
- `scripts/utils/storage_manager.py` — job storage with dedup + change detection
- `scripts/run_scraper.ps1` — main controller with retry + crash recovery
- `scripts/install_cron.ps1` — Windows Scheduled Task (10-min interval)
- Production safety: retry logic, exponential backoff, timeouts, atomic writes

## Files Created

- `README.md`
- `.gitignore`
- `agents/google_jobs_agent.yaml`
- `scripts/setup_environment.ps1`
- `scripts/run_agent.ps1`
- `scripts/run_scraper.ps1`
- `scripts/install_cron.ps1`
- `scripts/utils/__init__.py`
- `scripts/utils/logger.py`
- `scripts/utils/memory_manager.py`
- `scripts/utils/storage_manager.py`
- `memory/checkpoints/system_checkpoint.json`
- `memory/summaries/system_summary.md`
- `memory/sessions/session_20260220T000800Z.md`

## Current System Status

PRODUCTION_READY — all components implemented, system operational.

## Continuation Instructions

1. Run `.\scripts\setup_environment.ps1` to verify OpenClaw + MiniMax
2. Run `.\scripts\run_scraper.ps1` for a single scrape
3. Run `.\scripts\install_cron.ps1` (Admin) for scheduled execution
